    "text": "I am a graduate student in the quantitative social sciences which, from my vantage point as a somewhat-dedicated Twitter lurker, comes off as a hotbed of squabbles over competing methodologies and theories. My own (limited) experience with topics that cut across disciplinary lines, vague though these boundaries may be, has largely been…unpleasant. A major reason conversations break down is the often-opaque shield of disciplinary pecularities.1 And yet, there’s surely mutually beneficial exchanges to be had. Looking at tough and seemingly unassailable problems from different angles has a way of inspiring breakthroughs. The platitude notwithstanding, different fields working on similar problem may already have pieced together different parts of the puzzle; as such, “being the first to show [x]” in one’s narrow slice of the world probably isn’t all that great and such duplication of effort should (ideally) be discouraged. Can looking past disciplinary hang-ups and making progress on building a shared understanding not just save (valuable) time and effort but also spark creative solutions and ideas? I’d wager yes, but making an effort possibly couldn’t hurt. The goal here is mostly to share my thoughts on cool work that grabs me and to solicit hate mail from disciplinary gate-keepers 2.\nI’ve thought about the following problems, in some shape or form, for the past decade. To be clear, these are not unanswered questions, and while some of the proposed answers seem reasonable, I do think there’s more to be said. Some combination of youthful hubris and the need to write research papers to complete my degree has convinced me that I can, maybe, be this person. Here’s an (incomplete) list:\n\nHow do parents, well, parent? The copious amounts of viral parenting TikTok and Instagram reels, my window into a slice of this process, makes one thing abundantly clear: parenting is tough. The “How-To” parenting books business is certainly booming but, at the end of the day, there’s really no agreed upon guidebook. So, how do we even know how to parent? Looking around, an important source of (un)wanted input seems to be our families and broader support network. When people from some segment of society respond to a media item with “did we all have the same childhood?!?!”, it underscores the tepidity of promises to “break the cycle”. It’s probably more likely that we will simply pass on time-honored traditions of doing the Same Thing. If you got your elder sibling’s clothes once they’d aged out of them, you probably understand, in a microcosm, the anodyne calculus behind this process of passing down clothes but also “behavior”, “attitudes”, and even “political beliefs”. It’s just easier this way. But we’ve, literally, sailed past a world where almost everyone dies in the village of their birth. People move, sometimes to another city, but also increasingly, to other countries, and as they move, they take their particular set of physical and social objects with them. Passing down physical objects is fine, but this intergenerational transmission of social objects is often frowned upon and hubbub over assilimation infrequently comes to dominate the discourse. It sounds crazy, but this bewildering maze calls to me.\nHow do people, in a more general capacity than parents, learn things about the world? A chance conversation with my neighbor results in me finding out about a new bakery opening in the neighborhood, but what about more consequential things, say, whether the U.S. is going to annex Canada next month? How do I form beliefs about this? Who do I trust? Does who I surround myself with, my social network, so to speak, influence what beliefs I form? It sounds reasonable that it should. Even if we have the world’s knowledge at our fingertips, we’re continually learning new information from our friends and colleagues. If everyone I hang out with happens to like Nickleback, repeated exposure to their music may induce me to start liking it too, if only “ironically”. And not all social networks necessarily look alike, even with the same people in each. We relate to people in different ways, a process mediated, in part, by our personalities, and so the flow of information, or the types of sharing can be quite different. The architecture of our social networks captures some of this, but what does knowing an architecture give you? What can you say about influence, or how information will flow in response to some event?\nYou learn all sorts of neat quantitative tools as a quantitative researcher, but to use them, you really need to associate numbers with objects which, in my part of the academe, generally corresponds to some notion of value. Valuing things that already have prices is relatively straightforward, but how do we value stuff that doesn’t have prices or is just too abstract? There’s no product listing on Amazon for living in a neighborhood with a score of 2 on the Air Quality Health Index. One can, of course, just look up housing prices for neighborhoods with good air quality on Zillow, but that price probably captures a bunch of other stuff, like good schools close-by or a high walkability score, so backing out the air quality valuation is not really obvious. You’re probably thinking this entire edifice is rotten, but some researchers seem to (strongly) think otherwise.3 Why should we care how much people value air quality or noise pollution, anyway? Shouldn’t we just be striving for high air quality and low noise pollution everywhere? In short, yes, but absent this, people of an accounting bent need these values for (distasteful) planning purposes4, and it’s surely better for these values to be reasonable than not.\n\nIf any of this spiel speaks to you, or if you think I’m an idiot because [x] has already said the final word on any of these loose research hangers, feel free to reach out!\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nIt’s such a coincidence that everyone in my out-group sucks.↩︎\nHaters are of course welcome, although I would rather be friends. Really.↩︎\nTheir approach uses a fair bit of math, which probably inhibits its readability. I’m working on a post which compactly lays out their argument.↩︎\nWhat is the the statistical value of your life?↩︎"

These two facets complement each other well: I learn by writing, but I also write to share with others all that I’ve grokked, to learn from their insights1.\nHaving left home as a teenager, I’ve lived and learned in unfamiliar surroundings and inhabited discordant social realities for the better part of my life. The common threads in our inner lattice and the melody from our idiosyncratic chords both fascinate me. I’m deeply curious about the world and the people who call it home. I limp around the edges of understanding with the help of analogies, which feeds into my passion for translating concepts, ideas, and beliefs across disparate contexts and time. This digital artifact serves as record of my mischief-making and as an open invitation to all who find their peace in pursuing what plucks their heartstrings.

    "text": "All is not what it seems in the Beaches neighborhood of Toronto. Any veneer of normalcy is first shattered as the sanitized white glare surrounding me in the subway is supplanted by the sun’s diffuse spread. The subway, a beast of the city’s dark underbelly, recommunes with society, zooming past busy streets in the process. As it begrudgingly screeches to a halt, I step out of the train and gladly walk away from the incessant croaks and groans emanating from its joints. The litany of oddities only grows as the day progresses. An escalator from the subway platform descending into the bowls of Earth leads to the street. A right turn from the ordinary flatness of Kingston Road abruptly gives way to the steep decline of Blantyre Avenue. The skaters trudging up, boards in hand, suggest that the downward pull of gravity which terrifies pedestrians for its promise of asphalt is a boon to others. Nature nurtures landscape, guiding it through glacial transformation; humans, au contraire, are impatient. Our desires flaunt the constraints of our brief existence. Some plunge into despair from this realization; others carve up land to create skater heaven.\nThere is an uncanny symbiosis, a truce of sorts, between these two omnipresent forces, Nature and Human, along the Avenue’s stretch. I shrug at the sight of a thick tree sitting atop a car garage, with its bulging veins and arteries protruding into the air, past the boundary marked by the garage door. I exist outside this truce, and Nature compensates for temporarily relenting in its wrath by now affixing its full attention to torment. The sun unceremoniously beats down and shedding items of clothing offers little reprieve from the discomfort of a thousand needles pricking my skin.\nThe end of Blantyre Avenue looks upon a large well-maintained field. A short structure, by way of adornment, squats along the entirety of the field’s longer edge. This is the disappointing first-sighting for a visitor to the R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant. With their energies whittled away by the demands of the trek, the dejected may leave at this juncture, but it is to their loss: the deceptions continue with the Plant’s front lying on the other side of whence one approaches.\nTo get there, I walk across the fields - really the lungs of the Plant - and the multitude of manhole covers that hide concrete chambers holding gallons upon gallons of water from Lake Ontario. The water flows slowly in there, discarding the larger sediments it carries as it does, but its collective force is sufficient to render cracks in the concrete prison straining to contain it. The secret of this tremendous aquifer is belied by the faint reverberation of its motion that reach the surface; it only adds to the deliciousness of this knowledge that the telltale hum is easily missed. The atmosphere of tranquility about the place is generally misleading; motion can be found sequestered in every nook and cranny. The entire establishment is lined with a mind-boggling network of pipes that traverse the landscape under orders from a pumping house and its regiment of untiring machines that pump, pump and pump some more. They propel water from the lake into the chambers lining these fields, then push it forward still into the filtration building’s waiting filtration pools which augment earlier efforts at purification. The entire enterprise is well-oiled. It has to be. Its tentacles touch a third of the city with water clean enough to be drunk from taps. Disruptions in service are not just an inconvenience but potentially lethal.\nThe Plant has won as many accolades for its architecture rendered in the Art-Deco style, hidden from plain view but charging only some exertion for the pleasure, as for the remarkable feat of purifying a billion liters of water a day at a cent a liter. Its austere beauty, uncharacteristic of public infrastructure, has practical origins as a subtle persuasive tact. An essential human right today, clean water was relegated to unnecessary luxury in the near past, when the mechanisms of water-borne diseases were poorly understood. The derision of water purification as frivolous motivated the turn to an aesthetic argument: the hope was that the public, if not as impressed by the prospect of avoiding almost certain death from cholera, a then-popular haunt of public health, would at least be taken in by the facade’s attractiveness. These shrewd deliberations of astute public officials, conscious of the perilous nature of their stations and their subservience to the public’s whims, continue to pay off in the double dividends of functional and aesthetic value.\nI spent the day mostly in a state of awe, dotted with a smattering of discomfort’s ephemeral encroachments. I realize that the halls of polished marble, which I enjoyed in their sanitized glory, are surely stained by the drudgery of poor souls that toiled away in dangerous, sometimes lethal conditions. The day I visited the Plant marked its hundredth-anniversary; it is safe to say that the men that built it are long gone by now. But in the crowds crawling over every inch of the facility must be their families eager to get a taste of the world inhabited by their fathers, uncles, and grandfathers, and I am consoled by the thought of their lineages having a permanent marker for their loved one, a permanence that is denied to most of us in death.\nI can’t hold onto the sadness that accompanies these somber thoughts for long: our helplessness against the unrelenting march of time is a bitter but common truth. There is no extant trace of the thousands of men and women that manned the Plant, and, as visiting hours approach an end, the flurry of activity today, so precious in its rich complexity, will die down too, with most traces vanishing along with us. The scattering of wrappers, the footprints embossed into grass, and of course the memories will linger about longer, but with time, these too will disappear. The Plant, however, remains. It has withstood a hundred years of first arrivals and final departures, and it will stand a hundred years more still.\n\n\n\nThe gentle blue of the lake blends into the sky.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RC Harris Water Treatment Plant on a hot day in May.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese grimy pumps don’t look like much, but they are the engines of life in Toronto.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stern halls of the filtration plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nA mountain’s weight in water not far above their heads inspires polarized reactions in these gentlemen excavating a tunnel under Lake Ontario."

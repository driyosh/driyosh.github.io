title: "A (growing) mesh of links"

Greetings! I'm a grad student by day, and a writer by night. These two facets complement each other well: I learn by writing, but I also write to share with others all that I've grokked and learn from their insights^[The L-word is a mainstay of my personality.].

Having left home as a teenager, I've lived and learned in unfamiliar surroundings and inhabited discordant social realities for the better part of my life. I've grown to value both the common threads across our inner lattices and the rich diversity of the mosaic when people come together. I'm deeply curious about the world and the people who call it home. I limp around the edges of understanding with the help of analogies, which feeds into my passion for translating concepts, ideas, and beliefs across disparate contexts and time. This digital artifact serves as a record of my mischief-making and as an open invitation to all who find peace in pursuing their curiosities. You can read more about what drives [me](about.qmd), or sample some of my posts here.
